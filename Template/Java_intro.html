        <h2>What is Java?</h2>
        <p>
          Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It was developed by Sun Microsystems and is now owned by Oracle Corporation. Java is known for its portability, performance, and robustness.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Key Features of Java</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Platform Independence</strong>: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can be executed on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making Java applications highly portable.</li>
          <li><strong>Object-Oriented</strong>: Java is designed around the concept of objects, which allows for better organization of code and reuse of components.</li>
          <li><strong>Simple and Easy to Learn</strong>: Java syntax is clean and easy to understand, making it accessible to beginners while still being powerful for experienced developers.</li>
          <li><strong>Robust</strong>: Java provides strong memory management, exception handling, and type-checking mechanisms, which help prevent errors and improve reliability.</li>
          <li><strong>Secure</strong>: Java includes built-in security features such as bytecode verification and the ability to run code in a sandboxed environment, which enhances application security.</li>
          <li><strong>Multithreading</strong>: Java supports multithreading, allowing developers to write programs that can perform multiple tasks concurrently, improving application performance and responsiveness.</li>
          <li><strong>Rich Standard Library</strong>: Java comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides numerous utilities for tasks such as data manipulation, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) development.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Common Use Cases</h2>
        <p>
          Java is used for developing a wide range of applications, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Desktop Applications</strong>: Java provides libraries and frameworks such as Swing and JavaFX for building cross-platform desktop applications with rich graphical interfaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile Applications</strong>: Java is the primary language for Android app development, using the Android SDK and tools to create mobile applications for Android devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Web Applications</strong>: Java is used to build server-side components for web applications, utilizing technologies such as Servlets, JSP, and frameworks like Spring and JavaServer Faces (JSF).</li>
          <li><strong>Enterprise Applications</strong>: Java is widely used in enterprise environments for building scalable and secure applications, including systems for banking, insurance, and other large-scale businesses.</li>
          <li><strong>Embedded Systems</strong>: Java is also used in embedded systems and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, providing a robust platform for resource-constrained environments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started with Java</h2>
        <p>
          To get started with Java, follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Install Java Development Kit (JDK)</strong>: Download and install the JDK from the official Oracle website or an OpenJDK distribution.</li>
          <li><strong>Set Up a Development Environment</strong>: Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans to write and manage your Java code.</li>
          <li><strong>Create a New Project</strong>: Set up a new Java project in your IDE, write Java code, and compile it using the provided tools.</li>
          <li><strong>Run and Test Your Code</strong>: Execute your Java applications and test them to ensure they function as expected.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Java is a versatile and powerful programming language with a broad range of applications. Its strong feature set, platform independence, and extensive libraries make it a popular choice for developers working on various types of projects.
